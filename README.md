* There was no way to delete or edit a log. 
* The create form didn't have as much functionality. 
* I wasn't using any api
* The dropdown navbar didn't have any buttons, it didn't display all the information, and there were no popup modals.
* In the projects tab of this repo, [the card that says 'pre-intensive'](https://github.com/snekek/TripLog_web/projects/1#card-31251607) is everything I had done before this week, everything else that's marked as Done was finished during the intensive.

### How do I try this out?
This isn't fully usable, but many of the important features are ready. There is no way to make accounts yet so nothing is private, but have a [live demo availibile on heroku!](https://triplog-nic.herokuapp.com)

### What can I do with this?
* When making a new log, the drug textbox will suggest drug names. Using any of the suggested names means that TripLog can pull tons of information from the tripsit.me API and put it all into info cards. You can access the info cards by opening the drawer on the top left and clicking on the name of a drug.

* There is a text box at the bottom of the page that you can use to add timestamped notes about your experience.

* You can ask drug related questions to the AskTheCaterpillar API right in your note text box! Start your note with ???, like this "??? your question here" and a new note will appear on the screen with the answer to your question.

* If you're not feeling too hot and you need someone to talk to, open up the drawer on the top left and click the red "Help" button. This will link you to the tripsit.me assistance RCS chat, it's full of nice people that will try their best to help you out.

### What features are coming next?
Head over to [the projects tab](https://github.com/snekek/TripLog_web/projects/1) in this repo to see my progress and upcoming features.
